                    To understand her revolutionary literature, it is pertinent we trace Savitri Jyotirao Phule’s works back to against the backdrop of 19thcentury Maharashtra. 
                    Savitribai’s contribution to literature and culture was no less than her seminal role in social activism against oppressive caste structures and for the emancipation of women through education.

Her literary contribution changed the outlook and approach of feminist literature.
 She was an anti-caste activist who raised issues pertaining to caste and gender through her writings and speeches, as well as through direct intervention.
 She was probably among the first published modern, radical Marathi poets and writers in modern India, and was able to develop her own voice and agency at a time when women of all classes were ruthlessly suppressed and lived a sub-human existence.

Savitribai strongly criticised and openly challenged brahminical hegemony and the hierarchal oppressive social structures.
 She questioned and critically examined social evils such as caste, class and gender.
 During Savitribai’s time, brahminical exploitation was its peak in Pune and the surrounding areas. 
The rule of Peshwas was on the decline but a large section of society was ruthlessly oppressed in the name of religion, caste, class and gender.
 Savitribai not only witnessed this state of affairs from the outside but also as a survivor. 
She worked tirelessly to change the picture of humiliation and injustice.
